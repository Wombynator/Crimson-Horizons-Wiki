    <h2>Obtaining</h2>
    <p><strong>Natural generation:</strong> Regolith naturally generates across the game world, covering an extensive
        40% of the terrain. This means that players can typically find it by exploring the environment without the need
        for extensive mining or excavation.</p>
    <p><strong>Breaking:</strong> Another efficient method of collecting Regolith is by employing specialized <a href="/Crimson-Horizons-Wiki/items/drill">drills</a> or
        <a href="/Crimson-Horizons-Wiki/items/excavator">excavators</a>. These powerful machines can make short work of extracting Regolith from the ground, significantly
        speeding up the resource collection process. Whether you're setting up a mining operation or constructing
        large-scale infrastructure projects, using drills and excavators is the go-to choice for players looking to
        gather Regolith swiftly and effectively.</p>
    <p><strong>Crafting:</strong> While Regolith itself cannot be crafted, it serves as a crucial ingredient in various
        crafting recipes. Players can combine Regolith with other materials to create an array of structures and items.
    </p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p><strong>Crafting ingredient:</strong> As a versatile resource, Regolith has a diverse range of applications in
        the game:</p>
    <p>Crafting Ingredient: Regolith serves as a fundamental ingredient in many crafting recipes. Players can use it in
        conjunction with other materials to create buildings, roads, and pathways, enhancing their in-game environment
